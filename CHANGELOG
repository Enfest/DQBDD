# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Fixes
- added checks in DQDIMACS parser for errors and fixed parsing of free variables
- some solved instances by HQSpre during parsing were not caught, leading to a thrown exception
- changed the algorithm of localisation to save on memory/time

### New
- added parser for QBFs in prenex cleansed (D)QCIR format (prenex DQCIR is like prenex QCIR, where we can add quantifier henkin(v, v1, ..., vn) which represents existential variable v with dependency set {v1, ..., vn})
- added an option to force file format (otherwise it is selected automatically by file type)
