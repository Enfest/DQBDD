# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Fixes
- added checks in DQDIMACS parser for errors and fixed parsing of free variables
- some solved instances by HQSpre during parsing were not caught, leading to a thrown exception
- the copies of universal variables (which DQBDD does not rename) will now not be taken into account for computing the conditions of pushing existential variables for disjunction

### New
- added parser for QBFs in prenex cleansed (D)QCIR format (prenex DQCIR is like prenex QCIR, where we can add quantifier henkin(v, v1, ..., vn) which represents existential variable v with dependency set {v1, ..., vn})
- added an option to force file format (otherwise it is selected automatically by file type)
- DQBDD now works also on Mac
- changed how localisation is computed to save on memory/time
