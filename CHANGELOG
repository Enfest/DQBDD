# Changelog

## [1.3] - 20-04-2022
### New
- added parsing of non-cleansed prenex (D)QCIR format
- added two new options '--dqcir-output' and '--dqcir-output-cleansed' for printing parsed and possibly preprocessed input into given output file in non-cleansed or cleansed prenex DQCIR format (the option '--hqspre-dqcir-output' was removed, as '--dqcir-output-cleansed' with preprocessing turned on replaces it)
- quantifier trees used for localisation can now share subtrees, significantly reducing memory usage

## [1.2] - 09-04-2021
### Fixes
- added checks in DQDIMACS parser for errors and fixed parsing of free variables
- some solved instances by HQSpre during parsing were not caught, leading to a thrown exception
- the copies of universal variables (which DQBDD does not rename) will now not be taken into account for computing the conditions of pushing existential variables for disjunction

### New
- added parser for QBFs in prenex cleansed (D)QCIR format (prenex DQCIR is like prenex QCIR, where we can add quantifier depend(v, v1, ..., vn) which represents existential variable v with dependency set {v1, ..., vn})
- added an option to force file format (otherwise it is selected automatically by file type)
- DQBDD now works also on Mac
- changed how localisation is computed to save on memory/time
- added option '--hqspre-dqcir-output' which takes filename.dqdimacs file, preprocesses it with HQSpre and transforms the result (with gate extraction) into filename.dqcir

## [1.1] - 26-04-2020
### Fixes
- dynamic reordering is temporarily turned off during creation of existential dependency copies

### New
- added option to turn on/off dynamic reordering (turned on by default)
